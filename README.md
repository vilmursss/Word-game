# Word-game

I made this game for myself to study Spanish and specially to expand my Spanish vocabulary. I've already played many different language learning games, but usually all of them consists all the same beginner level words at the beginning, so I got slightly bored to re-learn the same words every time. That is why I decided to make a bit different kind word learning tool for myself.

The idea of this word learning tool is that you can enter your own data into it and you will play this game only with the data you have entered by yourself! At the moment the game consists approximately 500 words in Sqlite database, which I've studied, but there is an option to remove all the words from database, so you are able to start word saving from the scratch!

Development of this language learning tool is still under its way, but all main functions is already working properly. At the moment the game is only available for Spanish - English and/or Finnish translations (If you don't want to use both languages, then just leave Finnish/English field empty, while saving the word).
